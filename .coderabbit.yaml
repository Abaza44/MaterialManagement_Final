recommendations:
  performance:
    - "Consider async/await for database and I/O operations."
    - "Use caching for static lookups and repeated queries."
    - "Avoid heavy logic in controllers â€” move it to the service layer."
  naming:
    - "Use PascalCase for class and method names."
    - "Use camelCase for local variables and parameters."
  security:
    - "Validate all user inputs."
    - "Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection."
    - "Secure sensitive configuration values in environment variables."
